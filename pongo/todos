how to load data

how to handle errors at a global level

how to handle 

how to handle temporary data (so you can handle a state differently
depending on how you got there)
-   also, what data should be provided by the library on each call

how to handle persistent data 
-   i think its persist everything that's already persisted + whatever
    is marked for persistence by the user

what transition types are there 
-   standard, loopback, other?

a big builder with
-   an fsm builder
-   a response builder

should i write this in typescript?

technically, the built objects are just accessing the
builders through closures... is this okay?
-   prob not, but how to fix?
    -   use immutablejs? or just clone the data?

use immutable js? 
-   i sorta want to, but don't want to get too cray

define objects: 
-   data
-   state
-   anything else?
